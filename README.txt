qbehaviour_adaptivepenalty
=================

This is a question behaviour for Moodle Quiz that adds an additonal penalty
to the normal adaptive mode. This can be used to penalize students that 
procrastinate on assignments. 

Copy this directory to question/behaviour/adaptivepenalty in Moodle
directory. Login as admin to complete plugin installation.  On a quiz
that is set to adaptive mode, change to this behaviour after the due
date and allow a grace period for students that missed, but are allowed
to still complete it with a deduction.
